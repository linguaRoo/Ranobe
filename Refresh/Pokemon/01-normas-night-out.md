# Norma's Night Out

> [!NOTE] **Refresh**
> This is a story from the OzRoo Refresh series, based loosely on old fanfiction written in the 2000s. The stories may or may not closely resemble their originals, but they are intended to take 20 years of writing experience to refresh these stories for a more mature audience.

"I've never been so tempted to bite my claws," Kharm said as he approached Norma Lee, the head of the Osaka monster stadium. Offering a hand, he smiled. "You fought really well, Miss Norma. It's been a privilege."

"You cheated!"

The rebuke caught him off guard. Her stern glare locked on Kharm as she patted the Mootoro lying on the floor of the stadium. "Excuse me? How did I..."

"I don't have to give a badge to cheaters!" She huffed this time, her cheeks going plump as she walked around her monster. "The League policies say so."

"I understand that, but how did I..."

"If you understand, get out!" She shoved her index fingers up against his shoulders. "Just turn around and leave! There's no way Mootoro could lose to your measly little Ratty," she said as if it was a law of nature. "So you cheated. Come back again tomorrow without your drugged up rodent!"

"Drugged up? You took out my strongest monsters with that Mootoro," Kharm said, not wanting to deal with false accusations. "I won the fight, and while I may have been lucky, I have never cheated."

"Then you won't have any trouble rematching me tomorrow," Norma said. This time, however, she seemed a little less demanding, though she looked Kharm over. "Or maybe you can do me a favor tonight. What do you say?"

Kharm swallowed. A "favor" would probably not be in the normal League guidebook. "I earned the tag, Miss Lee. If you want a favor, you can ask me after you hand it over."

He could see her leg twitching and her nostrils flaring as she thought it over. He hoped he was coming off as confident and not creepy as he looked at her. "Fine!" She turned around. "I didn't bring any with me. If you'll do my favor, I'll have your badge at eight tonight. Take a bath and dress nice."

It had to be the strangest way Kharm could imagine to be asked on a date. She had been blowing up his cell phone with text messages to make it clear that he was expected to be a gentleman and let her do whatever she wanted tonight.

He looked in the mirror and sighed. At least it wasn't a full suit, but he hated collared shirts. And ties. Still, it was probably to be expected of someone going on a date with a Stadium Boss. He looked sharp enough.

"Kharm-san," the voice startled him. "Other guests need the changing room too. Please leave in the next five minutes."

Right, this lodge was a public accommodation for tamers. A clinic downstairs, common rooms upstairs with bathing and changing facilities. It wasn't a lot, but he'd gotten used to the charm of the free lodgings in every town and city along the road so far. "I understand," he said taking stock of his outfit one last time. If only he had the time to get to a salon...

He picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder. He still had about an hour before the start of the date. He should take in a bit of the city life.

Osaka was a lively city. A little bit noisy, but it was the biggest, most modern city in Kansai. An intersection of tradition and modernity, the new business towers and mansions sticking out in the heart of the region.

There were signs up for a performance at the HEP Five, some sort of upcoming Koppykat show running for a week. The posters featured three of the shapeshifting monsters in front of red curtains. Kharm thought it might be interesting to see, but on closer inspection, he would have to stay in town a day longer than he had planned to catch the first show.
