## Hypnotism & Mind Control

There are a variety of ways to engage with _Hypnotism_ in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and this is a special ruleset geared towards social roleplaying settings where physical combat is seconday.

### The Basics of Hypnotism

Hypnotism produces an altered state of mind in which a subject becomes more suggestible than normal. The _hypnotist_ gains a temporary bonus to their social reaction and loyalty checks from their subject, but the subject is not powerless even if under the effects of _hypnotism._

All forms of initiating _hypnotism_ allow for a saving throw versus sleep or charm effects, and a successful saving throw negates the attempt to use _hypnotism._ Some methods may allow other defenses, but the core defense against _hypnotism_ is the saving throw versus sleep or charm effects.

While a subject is under the influence of _hypnotism,_ the hypnotist may take additional special actions. Each of these actions provokes a new saving throw before it produces any effects.

## Ego Points

Ego Points are a general purpose measure of the strength of the individual's mind. Subjects who have suffered Ego Point damage have their saving throw penalized by the amount of damage their ego has taken.

| Character Class     | Ego Die (Level 1-10) | Ego Boost (Level 11+) |
|:--------------------|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Warrior, Magic-User | d6                   | +2                    |
| Cleric, Rogue       | d4                   | +1                    |
| Psionicist          | d8\*                 | +3\*                  |

Ego points are always awarded at the maximum value for their die, plus additional Ego Points equal to their Hit Point adjustment. Psionicists gain the parenthetical values to Ego Points that warriors gain to Hit Points.

If a character is reduced to 0 Ego Points, they fall unconscious for 1d3 minutes, and asleep for 1d12 times 10 minutes (including the time they are unconscious). While unconscious or asleep, a character cannot be subjected to _hypnotism_ by any means. After waking up from this sleep, the character recovers 1 Ego Die of their ego points.

### Recovering Ego Points

Ego points may be recovered by the same means as hit points, including magical or psionic healing techniques. In addition to this, a character may recover 1 ego die of ego points per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation, reflection, prayer, or otherwise unworking except on their mental state.

Any character who receives a healthy night's sleep will recover the maximum number of ego points provided by their ego dice times their highest class level.
