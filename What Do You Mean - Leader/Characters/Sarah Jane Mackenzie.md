# Sarah Jane Mackenzie

Sarah is one of [Aphrodite's](aphrodite.md) candidates for diplomatic liaison. She was born and raised as a human on Gaea, unaware of her powers until after Aphrodite contacted her. Sarah is 14 during the first chapter, and 18 during the bulk of the story (though there may be flashbacks showing her as young as 6)

## Family

**Arthur Ronald Mackenzie** (42) - A robotics developer for an automotive company. He is the primary earner in the Mackenzie household, keeping the family well in the upper-middle-class strata despite (or perhaps due to) living in a smaller town instead of a city or suburb. He is generally clueless about home and family situations.

**Gwen Ophelia Mackenzie** (nee Sinclair; 38) - A secretary and personal assistant who works in Pinckney. She works only part-time in order to get extra spending money, much of which goes towards family holidays and vacation spending.

**Leonard David Mackenzie** (25) - Sarah's "darling big brother" Len is studying robotic engineering and computer science in order follow in his father's footsteps. He often tries to _help_ Sarah with things she doesn't need help with.

**Robert Harold Mackenzie** (22) - Sarah's "creepy big brother" Rob is at college on a basketball scholarship. He finds Sarah just as creepy as she finds him, but due to certain things Sarah knows, he tries to stay out of her way.

**Charles Ewan Mackenzie** (17) - Sarah's adoring and doting little brother Charles, or Chaz, would do anything for his big sister. He helps her study and practice her skills, unaware of how Sarah plans to really use them -- or how she's really manipulating him.

## Friends

**Paul Winger** (18) - Sarah views Paul more as a rival than a friend, but he is still one of the closest things she has to a peer. Sarah conducted a hypnotic duel with Paul during their last year of high school, and respects his willpower to resist her, given how rare it is for her peers to resist her hypnotic influence. Sarah's relationship with Paul is currently bad because she attempted to hypnotize Faye into being Paul's slave before the Spring Fling.

**Faye Evans** (18) - After her duel with Paul, Sarah has spent some time with Paul and Faye, trying to play matchmaker and convince Faye (without hypnosis) to make the first move in dating Paul. Faye is the only girl Sarah will confide in if she wants a genuine response. Faye, unlike Paul, appreciates Sarah's attempt to hypnotize her into being Paul's slave in time for the Spring Fling.

## Personality

Sarah suffers from the effects of mild emotional neglect in her home life, and acts out by playing the role of a glorious woman in charge to conceal her emotional emptiness. She struggles to understand and respect the boundaries of others. Sarah does not seem to be influenced by the Westermarck Effect or incest taboos.

Despite considering herself fairly liberal and dedicated to egalitarian/feminist ideals, Sarah sees social life as a struggle for dominance, and she sees herself as deserving the highest position. She is willing to work to that end, but prefers to use psychological manipulation, including hypnotism, to acquire obedience, rather than softer social strategies to win loyalty.

## Powers

Sarah has the typical range of psychic and magical powers available to the nine challengers on Angel Wing Island, though she has focused her training on psychology and hypnotism more than use of her magical or psychic abilities.

### Transformation

Sarah has been unconsciously practicing microtransformation since she was twelve, possibly younger. This is the practice of making minor transformations, typically for vanity, often so small that they are impossible to detect as they happen. Sarah has used her transformation power in this way to form and maintain what she considers a perfect body.

### Psychic Abilities

Sarah has a potent empathic ability that is tuned towards her own goals of manipulating others: She is able to intuitively figure out what most people want within only a few casual conversations. She is not skilled at psychic projection of any sort.

### Magic Abilities

Sarah has studied mind-altering and illusion magic, though she is only capable of casting them at a novice level. Her most powerful spell is called "Image of the Divine" and combines the effects of _Charm Person_ and _Visible Glamer_ to grant herself a glowing aura only visible to those who see her favorably, whether by the Charm effect of this spell or otherwise. She is able to maintain _Image of the Divine_ for approximately five (5) minutes before she exhausts her magical ability.

### Unique Abilities

Sarah possesses a unique ability which is classified as a _Glamour_ power. While it is not officially named in the story, it is called _Glamourous Confidence_ at present.

Sarah's confidence passively projects a [Verse Magic aura](Verse_Magic.md) which causes people within sensory range of her to develop a more favorable attitude, including the possibility of increased attraction and trust, towards her. While negative impressions, or mere competitiveness, are enough to mitigate the development of this attraction, only active hostility can neutralize it. Because Sarah gains confidence as she successfully manipulates others into obedience, this power can snowball most effectively in a situation where she is able to have many interactions with people who have neutral or positive attitudes towards her, and she can command their obedience.

### Other Abilities

Sarah has devoted herself to studying psychology, hypnotism, and various other forms of mental manipulation and conditioning. She is capable of bringing most people into a trance or other suggestible state as long as she has even slightly favorable conditions in which to work. She is also dedicated to manipulating, and exploiting, the beliefs of others to her advantage, and is capable of convincing her subjects to agree to things they might not agree to for anybody else, even with the same level of trust. This is partly thanks to her _Glamorous Confidence_, which causes people to see her as more trustworthy.

## Motivation

Sarah wants to control others and the attention that they pay to her. She accepts the opportunity to compete under Aphrodite on the assumption that if she wins, she will be able to justify calling herself a _goddess._
