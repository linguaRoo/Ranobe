Verse Magic is a specialized sort of magic which bypasses most forms of magical protection, resistance, defense, and even immunity. Verse Magic does not rely on a normal magical weave to operate, and often interacts with psychic abilities.

Control of Verse Magic requires specialized training and study, and most people who possess Verse Magic manipulate it without awareness until they are trained in some other form of magic.
