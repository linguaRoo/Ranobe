Dean was napping when the door swung open and the pink-haired girl who had greeted him walked in with a cart in tow. She seemed unhappy. "Quech dama?"

She turned to the brown-haired steward first, and then Dean noticed the steward, Roman, pointing over to him. She walked closer "Aur yi ya yanitot?"

"Techi," Dean said. He didn't want to get overwhelmed with this language since he was still tired, but he had asked Lady Amber to teach him some and he was picking it up reasonably well. "Ah, chi yanitolmerintas. Liyera yanis."

She reade up to her collar and tapped something. "I knowing," the girl said. "Jurin, my name. New candidate, Mackenzie. Soon inward come."

"You're using a device instead of the spell?"

"Roman, me spell gives. Knight Captain commands."
