“Rachel, how many times have I told you not to steal from paying customers? The knight found your ring in his room this morning. What were you doing in there? You know that you’re supposed to stay out of the customers’ rooms. What did you take from him?”

“I didn’t take anything from him Uncle Frodo. I was going up to our room, and I heard him saying something about being hot, so I went in to give him some cold water to drink. There wasn’t a glass there, so I went to get one, and by then, my ring had already fallen off. I know better than to search through your customers’ personal stuff, so I didn’t bother to look for it. Even thieves have some honor Uncle Frodo. I have a reputation to protect. Did he even report anything missing, Uncle Frodo?”

“No, but he might not have checked everything. If he reports anything missing, you aren’t gonna see that Ben-Jor fella anymore. You’re parents never would’ve let ya get so bad. Just to be safe, you go up to your room, and stay there till morning. And if ya took anything from him or his friends, return it and apologize first.”

“All right, Uncle Frodo.” Rachel replied, and immediately went upstairs.
