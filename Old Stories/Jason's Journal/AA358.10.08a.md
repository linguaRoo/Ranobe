[Previous: AA358.10.07](Old%20Stories/Jason's%20Journal/AA358.10.07.md)  

Jason awoke with a voice in his head saying: "*Jason, did you get the books?*"

J: "*Sara! Yes I got the books. Could you try not to call when I’m sleeping?*"

S: "*Yeah, sorry if I woke you up. Have you started reading them?*"

J: "*Yes, I’m reading* The Wizard of Oz. *I think that it’s very weird.*"

S: "*That’s sort of what I thought the first time my parents read it to me. Did you get the scroll?*"

J: "*Yes, and thanks for the gift. It’s just what I always wanted. By the way, last night I dreamt of Cozum again. Thor, Jed, and Wayrwulf were there too.*"

S: "*Werewolf?*"

J: "*It’s spelled W-a-y-r-w-u-l-f. It’s Howoo’s real name.*"

S: "*I didn’t think animals had dreams.*"

J: "*Neither did I. Look, how about I call you in a couple days, OK.*"

S: "*All right, Good night.*"

J: "*Good night to you too Sara.*"
