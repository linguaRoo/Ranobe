I awoke early today. Before the others woke, I rigged an intravenous device to give Kirora her Dracula’s Wine. After I filled it, I hooked it inside the shelter of the carrier.

I finished making a long bow this morning. About an hour later, I got to test it. I saw a sand lion charging us, so I strung the bow, nocked an arrow, and let it fly. When we got to the corpse, we made camp for midday, and Buzz and Thor decided to skin it. I’d hit it from over 100 lengths, and I hit right between the eyes. Kirora awakened and I told her to rest. She took my advice.

The rest of the day passed without incident. Unless, of course, you count the stench of sand lion hide following us. We made camp a day away from the next oasis, or so I hope. I decided that tonight I’ll call Sara, but not until I’ve read 2 chapters from *The Wizard of Oz*.
