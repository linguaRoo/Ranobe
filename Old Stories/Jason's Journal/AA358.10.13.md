I awoke to an odd scent. Somehow, I had been moved to my tent, and the stranger was awakening me. I asked, once again, who he was, and he introduced himself as Pollock, the chief healer in Olympia. I introduced myself and my friends, and then told him about Kirora. “She is in desperate need of a blood transfusion. Until recently, she was a vampire, and she barely made it this far.” He said that he would take us to the gates of Olympia, and then he would take her to the Adventurer’s Hospital. He sent word to the town’s best innkeeper that 4 people would arrive at the inn seeking rooms, and that they should have good rooms.

We arrived at the town gates at sunset. Pollock told us to go straight for 4 blocks, and that the inn was right there. We then parted ways. A short while later, we arrived at The Rusty Lantern Inn. We told the owner, who was a Hobbit, that we needed rooms for the night, and he showed us to them. “Tonight,” he said, “they’re free, but after tonight you pay for ‘em. If ya need anything, just call me. My name’s Frodo. Frodo Baggins.” We then went to our rooms, and slept.
