Day 1 of our trek through the Desert. We still don’t have any fresh meat, so Thor owes me 20¶. We made good time today, we passed 2 of the oases on Thor’s map, and are camping at the third. At this rate, we should be at Dirt’s place in 3 days. Nathan gladly left when I told him to, which was a surprise to me. He hasn’t left me alone for more than a month since we went to Camp Black two years ago. Of course that’s not including the two months I had to stay for my knight training. Thor went off hunting with his wolf, Howoo. Maybe they’ll find some meat, but I doubt it. Well, I better cook some food for dinner, I know Thor won’t find any food here. Fortunately, my magic will help me out with flavoring the food, after all spices would have been a waste of space since we have a mage. Oh well, the prices of being an adventurer.

I knew Thor wouldn’t find anything. That means another day without meat for us. Well, I wasn’t expecting any meat anyway. Howoo will guard us tonight, and maybe tomorrow we shouldn’t travel so quickly. If we go slower, we can take watch and maybe Howoo will have better luck sniffing out some game. Nonetheless, we would have to eat all the meat within a day or somehow preserve it to last the trip. Well, with my power, at least that wouldn’t be a problem.
