## Journal Entry 21 (Jason Knight)

I have not kept my journal for 4 days because of the storm. Yesterday, Sara met us. I had thought that she would wait the storm out, but she didn’t. Buzz kept complaining about not having any fruit, so when Sara showed up, I was grateful for her supply of fresh food. Last night, I saw the Silver Dragon. We made it to the mouth of the first cave as well.

Today, we explored the cave, and found the Björndike Shrine. I put the Blessing Wine under the altar, and then we left. We continued on our way, but along a new course. We now headed directly towards Mt. Evearitt, and the cave there. I think that maybe the Silver Dragon can help us.

I made food from Sara’s provisions and everyone was happy at dinner tonight. Sara told me that her tent got destroyed  by the storm, and that she had been sleeping in cracks, crevices, and small cave pretty much since she’d entered the Mountains. I offered to let her sleep in my tent, and she accepted. I told her that I really didn’t need all that space anyway. Fortunately for me, she’d managed to save everything but the tent. After dark, Sara told us 2 stories. The first was called The Sorcerers Apprentice, the second was called Jabberwock. She illustrated them over the fire with illusions.
