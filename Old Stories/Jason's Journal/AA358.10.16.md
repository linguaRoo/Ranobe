## Journal Entry 19 (Jason Knight)
**Previous:** [AA358.10.15](Old%20Stories/Jason's%20Journal/AA358.10.15.md)

This morning Frodo gave me an envelope marked: to: Jason

I bathed in the inn’s private bath after I put the envelope with my other stuff. After I had donned my outer garments, I met with Thor, Jed, and Buzz at the door. We then went on our way. Rachel met us at the Adventurer’s Hospital. Rachel gave me her ring and said that I could have it. Kirora was waiting for us there, and Pollock brought her out to meet us. We told him that we were leaving town, and that if he was coming, he’d have to leave with us. So he packed his stuff, and we left the town.

After entering the mountains, we headed northward. We may not find the Sword of Herakles in the first cave, but I think that we will find the Björndike Shrine there. It’s dark now, and all of our light is from the fire. After we had set up camp, Pollock came to me and said that I should be careful around Kirora. After evening meal, I opened the envelope. Inside was a message reading:

> Jason:
> find enclosed 1 (one) scroll of growth. myrlinn the mage.

The scroll was in the envelope, and after hiding it, I went to sleep.
