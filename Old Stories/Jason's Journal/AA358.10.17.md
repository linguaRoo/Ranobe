## Journal Entry 20 (Jason Knight)

This morning it was raining, so we waited to break camp. While we waited, I transcribed the Growth spell into my spellbook. Afterwards, I tested it. I made some new crystals from some soil, and made them grow. They trapped a vial of Dracula’s Wine, and a vial of what I think is Holy Water inside them. However, it pushed the crystal sculpture of Sara aside. Perhaps it cannot trap magically created crystals.

Though the storm is still raging, I convinced everyone that we should keep going on our journey. So we traveled through the storm.

The storm is worse than ever, but we still travel, now by the light of a Gloworb spell.  We stopped here for food, but we’re going to keep traveling until we find a cave where we could all sleep for the night.

Not a cave in sight, and we’re all getting tired. It’s been hours since we ate, and we need to rest. I’ll ask Thor if I can house a Shelter spell in Mjolnir.

I am glad that Thor agreed. I can house the spell in Mjolnir, and we can sleep.
