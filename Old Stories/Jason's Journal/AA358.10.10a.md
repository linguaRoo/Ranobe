## Journal Entry 13 (Jason Knight)

Kirora’s body has now basically resumed natural functions, but she is still not strong enough to walk. We should get to Olympia in a few days, but I don’t know exactly when. Buzz is running out of fruit, so I told him to eat meat, like everyone else here. Though he is not a vegetarian, he prefers fruit, like most elves. My research on the Crystalize spell is going quite well. Already I can create small diamond hard crystals out of sand, and hopefully I shall be able to test it on some water tonight.

The spell is far stronger than I had thought. As I tested it on the water, a stray thought of Sara crossed my mind. When the crystal showed up, it was a beautiful statue of Sara. Tomorrow, I shall try to crystallize a patch of air.

Evening meal was filling tonight. According to Tomodak’s map, we should arrive in Olympia in 2 days. Once we arrive, we will have to stay a while. After all, Kirora will need to get a blood transfusion, and we have to give her body time to rest afterwards so the blood cells will regenerate. The stay will be good however, because we’ll all be tired by then.
