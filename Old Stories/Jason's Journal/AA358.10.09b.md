## Telepathic Conversation (Jason Knight, Sara Tarylian)
[AA358.10.09a](Old%20Stories/Jason's%20Journal/AA358.10.09a.md)

J: "*Sara, are you there.*"

S: "*Yes. Have you had any more bad dreams?*"

J: "*No. What element are you specializing in?*"

S: "*Fire. Fierce and powerful, some of the strongest spells.*"

J: "*I would have thought that you’d take Air. The strongest wind,*"

S: "*Blows unseen. The strongest voice is seldom heard.*"

J: "*The strongest blaze lies deep within, but strongest of them all to feel, is Water, that which makes all heard.*"

S: "*Well, you don’t exactly strike me as the strong and silent type, Jase.*"

J: "*All right, I get the point. How are your studies going?*"

S: "*They’re going quite well. But right now, I have to return to my Kha Cou lessons. Later Jase.*"
