## Journal Entry 15 “Sandstorm” (Jason Knight)
[Previous: AA358.10.11](Old%20Stories/Jason's%20Journal/AA358.10.11.md)

When I awoke this morning, there was a dry feeling in my throat. As I left my tent, I looked around and saw Buzz and Thor building a shelter around Kirora. I looked northward, and saw something approaching us rapidly. A stranger on horseback rode up from the south, and said, “Hurry up! The sandstorm will be here soon!” I asked him who he was, and he said, ”If we survive this, I’ll tell you.” Jed had taken over Buzz’s part of the work on the shelter, and Buzz now came running out from his tent, with a crystal ball and a pedestal. He set the ball on the pedestal, and came toward me. When he arrived, he said, “Focus a Wall spell at it, boy!” I immediately cast Stonewall at the ball. He then cast a Wall of Floodwaters at the ball. Thor must have known what we were doing, for out of the corner of my eye, I saw him approach, and focus the powers of Mjolnir at the ball. The stranger went towards Kirora, and examined her. After that point I know of nothing until the storm was over. Buzz and I had both exceeded our limits, and we immediately collapsed upon dropping our spells.
