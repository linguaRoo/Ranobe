Sara: "***JASON!!!***"

Jason awoke to this telepathic yell. "*Huh?! Sara, what’s wrong?*"

Sara: "*I had a terrible nightmare. But, I also have some good news.*"

Jason: "*Really? What’s the good news?*"

Sara: "*I graduated to Traveling Mage today. I can go out and meet you now. In fact I’m leaving tomorrow.*"

Jason: "*Great! You’ll have to meet us in the mountains though. We’re leaving town day after tomorrow.*"

Sara: "*All right. I’ll tell you my nightmare when I catch up.*"

Jason: "*All right. Sleep well, Sara. See ya soon. I miss you*"
