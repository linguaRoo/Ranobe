The Crystalize spell is amazing. I’ve decide to try to sell a copy of it to the town mage once we get to Olympia. If I’m lucky, I might make 1 or 2 ç, however, as an ‘untried’ spell, I'll probably get little more than 20 ¶ for it. It’s still worth a try.

Kirora is healing well. Other than her lack of blood, she’s just fine. I won’t risk her health by letting her walk yet, since she has very little real blood, even though carrying her slows us down. I think that we shall arrive in Olympia tomorrow, and then, we’ll be able to get her some real blood at the Adventurer’s Hospital.

I’ve seen mountains distinctly on the horizon since noon. While we were making camp, Thor scouted ahead and found the road to Olympia. I finished the scroll for Crystalize after evening meal, and it’s exactly the same as the page in my spellbook. We’re doing far better than expected, and we should arrive in Olympia tomorrow afternoon. We’ll stop by the Adventurer’s Hospital, drop Kirora off for a blood transfusion, and then go to the inn. I heard from one of the pilgrims that the best inn in town is The Rusty Lantern, an inn run by a Hobbit.
