J: Kitasha? do you hear me?

V: if you speak to me, at least address me by my proper name. I am vimora

J: no. you are Kitasha.

V: NO! I am Vimo... Arghhhhh!!! \[voice is now gentle and polite\] how do you know my name? who are you?

J: my name is Jason Knight, and i have seen your name in the legends.

V: How does a woman of 25 years get into legends?

J: those legends are very old. more than a century old.

V: It was only 2 years ago that I defeated Vimora. I know that for fact.

J: No, you killed her 132 years ago. At least, according to the legend.

V: \[voice is rough now, but still polite] Both Kitasha and Vimora died on the same night. their spirits lived on for weeks. But now, neither of them exists.

J: I suppose not, Kirora.

V: How do you know my name?

J: Rumors and legends. Will you help us?

V: why should i?

J: to protect what you call a life.

V: you could not end my life if you wanted to.

J: Nor could you end mine.

V: i will help you, if you protect me from other undead.

J: why do you need protection from them?

V: because i am writing the Book of the Nightwalkers. \[she Falls out from behind rock. She has fainted]

J: so that’s what she looks like.
