# Skye Taylor

Skye Taylor is [Gordon Sparks'](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Gordon%20Sparks.md) unrequited crush and best female friend. She's not in college, instead working at a floral nursery and as a freelance artist. She gets invited to dinner with Gordon during the story, and he has Angela use the [Hypnotic Penlight](Hypnotic%20Penlight) to prepare Skye.

Skye is allowed to remain aware of Gordon's control over her, but unable to tell anybody about it without his permission. She is also given a homunculus named Raine Bows which will keep her loyal to Gordon and his control even when he's not nearby.
