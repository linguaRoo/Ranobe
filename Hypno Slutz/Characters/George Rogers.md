# George Rogers

George Rogers is the second son of Nancy Rogers, and is a freshman at the College. He plans to become a health and fitness trainer, and maintains a leanly muscled form. Despite their age difference, he hit it off quickly [Josh Bruin](Josh%20Bruin) and [Angela Sparks](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Angela%20Sparks.md) and became their boyfriend.

Unknown to himself and [Sam Wagner](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Sam%20Wagner.md), the two are half-brothers through Nancy Rogers. While George doesn't know Sam very well, he does think that Sam is cute even from the first time they meet. Sam creates the persona of [Chad Jones](Chad%20Jones) in George in order to keep their relationship a secret from everyone, and to assure that George, as Chad, will never question him.
