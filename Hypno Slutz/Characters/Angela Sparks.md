# Angela Sparks

Angela is a 23-years old Child Development major, and the older sister of [**Gordon Sparks**](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Gordon%20Sparks.md). She is a pure hearted woman who is sensitive about her petite figure. She is polyamorous and dating [[George Rogers]], [[Josh Bruin]], and [[Megan Tabor]].

After her first session with the [[Hypnotic Penlight]], Angela lives a double life as [[Namira Slutz]], a whore who replaces Angela at 10 PM every day, after tying up any of Angela's loose ends. Namira returns to Gordon for her nightly assignments, and slowly begins to replace Angela for longer periods of time. She is shameless about sex, but always requires money up front.
