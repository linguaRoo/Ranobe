# Megan Tabor

Megan Tabor is 24 years old and is in the Computer Sciences program at Local University. She is sexually liberated and openly proud as bisexual and polyamorous, and does not hide her relationships with [Angela Sparks](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Angela%20Sparks.md), [Josh Bruin](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/Josh%20Bruin.md), [George Rogers](Hypno%20Slutz/Characters/George%20Rogers.md), or [[Kevin Prima]] (who is monogamous).

Megan is the first person to notice Angela's strange behaviour after the birth of [Namira Slutz](Namira%20Slutz), and takes it on herself to figure out what's going on...
