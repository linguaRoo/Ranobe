# The Brief

Toyland was abandoned in the 1980s. It's been more than 30 years since any worker has entered it, and nobody knows why the Toy Company abandoned this factory. The company is one of the big ones, still active today, but the factory just... closed down.

Here's what we know:

The factory was originally built in 1927, but was temporarily shuttered during the Depression. They re-opened to support the war effort, and by 1949 they were back to producing toys and select school supplies. The factory was bought out by the big company in the 60s, and it was supposedly used to make test lines. The first Charlie the Cheetah models were supposedly developed and assembled here, before they hit the primary market.

In the 1970s there were a series of incidents involving test toy lines. The Li'l Brudder dolls were an unmitigated disaster and inspired those killer doll movies. Research suggests they were using toxic paints that made some of the kids who got test models suffocate while snuggling up with their Li'l Brudders in bed, and the ones who didn't all became very violent.

Following that, the Friendly Monster line was introduced ripping off Muppet designs. Freddy Frog, Charlotte Cat, Derek Dog, and Lucy Llama. Almost every kid who got one said that the eyes were following them everywhere. A few caused incidents after taking their Friendly monsters to playdates. They said their monster told them to do the things they did... and that they had to be good friends.

In 1979, they released a baby doll, Little Lisa Angel, and... well, the stories about her are anything but angelic.
