# Introduction

Hi. I'm, well, you can call me JoJo. I grew up playing adventure and exploration games, and developed a taste for exploring the world around me from a young age. Beaches, rock climbing, deep forest hide and seek, I even know a bit about hunting, camping, and other survivalist stuff. But one day, back when I was barely a teenager, I found my real passion: Urban exploration.

I find abandoned buildings or sneak into active construction sites, and just explore them when nobody is around. The first time was just an empty house a few blocks from home, it had been listed for over a year, and during one showing, I managed to just, hide away in one of the closets so I could explore the house later that night. Once the agent had locked up, I opened a window above the back porch, slipped out, and closed the window enough to not be noticed...

...but this isn't about my whole life. No, this about the night that changed my team's life. This is about our little urban exploration into the abandoned toy factory in the next town over. To protect everybody from getting any ideas... let's just call it Toyland.
