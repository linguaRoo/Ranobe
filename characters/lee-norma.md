Norma Lee (リー・ノーマ), born as Tanaka Naomi (田中 なおみ), got into Biomonster taming as a 10 year old, quickly showing herself to be a prodigy who challenged the Quartz League Kansai Conference, and earned the respect of the former Normal-Beast Stadium Boss of Osaka, Sleepy Norman (スリピー・ノーマン), who took her on as a protege.

When Norman transferred to the Hokkaido League in 1999, Norma was promoted to the Stadium Boss at 17 years old. She has taken to the responsibility of the title well, and battles with the personality of a spoiled brat to throw her opponents off -- particularly trying to make them beat her twice before giving out her Stadium Tag. Her record for drawing out the process of awarding the tag is four battles.

## Osaka Stadium Challenge
Norma runs her stadium challenge as a gauntlet of three trainers, one of her Stadium Lieutenants, and herself for first-time challengers. Repeat challengers are able to advance directly to her.

## Team & Strategy
For first (and second) time challengers, Norma typically runs a team of Chantaloo, Squigret, and her specialty and favorite: Mootoro.

For challenges outside of her normal course of duties in the Stadium, Norma has a variety of Normal-Beast monsters in her roster, from the unassuming Rattack to the massive Slumbear -- the secret powerhouse with which she showed off her power in the 2001 Quartz League Kansai Conference.

## Personal Tastes
Norma became a trainer because everybody else was into monster taming, and she could fit in with it. She was such a skilled tamer that her friends all encouraged her to register with the Quartz League. She retains a childlike love of all things pink and cute, and still behaves very childishly.

She sometimes expresses regrets about becoming a Stadium Boss so young, and says it has kept her from exploring relationships. She feels unable to commit to dating because of her responsibilities, but sometimes uses her cute charms to manipulate adult Stadium challengers into taking her on an expensive date rather than coming back for a rematch.

### Sexual Tastes
Sometimes Norma will challenge her coerced dates to satisfy her sexually in her apartment, leaving the Tag with their clothes before she starts her morning training. Norma is dominant in bed, telling her partners what do with the same confidence she uses in battles. She will use ribbons for mild bondage, but has no strong inclination for BDSM other than this.

Norma enjoys oral and manual stimulation more than penetrative sex, though she has allowed several of her partners to do PIV intercourse with a condom. She is committed to her duties as a Stadium Boss and refuses to take any risk of becoming pregnant.

Norma also has a policy of never having the same partner twice: No attachments, no commitments.
