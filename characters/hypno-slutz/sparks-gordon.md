Gordon Sparks is a 20-years-old pre-law student with a hypnosis kink and a tinkerer's spirit. He spends his summers making hypnotic toys with his best friend [[characters/hypno-slutz/wagner-sam]], and is shocked when their latest toy, the [[Hypnotic Penlight]], works better than he ever intended.

Gordon has had a crush on his sister, [[characters/hypno-slutz/sparks-angela|Angela]], since he was 14, and makes her his first target. He creates the obedient and sexually needy [[Namira Slutz]] as a persona within Angela so his sister will remain unaware of their incestuous relationship.
