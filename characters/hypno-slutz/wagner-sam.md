# Sam Wagner

Sam Wagner is the gay best friend of [[characters/hypno-slutz/sparks-gordon]]. He's a guitarist and singer in the band Full Moon Howl, and enjoys playing with sound and lighting equipment. He's studying rocket science in college, and dabbles in making playful hypnotic toys with Gordon.

He's developed a crush on a new resident in his dorm, 18-years-old [[characters/hypno-slutz/rogers-george]], unaware that they are half-brothers with the same mother. Sam initially tests his [[Hypnotic Penlight]] on Gordon as they explore how deep of a trance it can induce, but quickly turns to focus on making George his completely devoted fuck toy.
