# George Rogers

George Rogers is the second son of Nancy Rogers, and is a freshman at the College. He plans to become a health and fitness trainer, and maintains a leanly muscled form. Despite their age difference, he hit it off quickly [bruin-josh](characters/hypno-slutz/bruin-josh.md) and [sparks-angela](characters/hypno-slutz/sparks-angela.md) and became their boyfriend.

Unknown to himself and [wagner-sam](characters/hypno-slutz/wagner-sam.md), the two are half-brothers through Nancy Rogers. While George doesn't know Sam very well, he does think that Sam is cute even from the first time they meet. Sam creates the persona of [Chad Jones](Chad%20Jones) in George in order to keep their relationship a secret from everyone, and to assure that George, as Chad, will never question him.
